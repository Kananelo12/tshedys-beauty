## About Tshedy’s Beauty Parlour – Our Story

Tshedy’s Beauty Parlour began with a little girl who simply loved beauty and hair.

From a very young age, Tshedy was always drawn to hair and styling. She even believed her dolls needed hair. As a child, she would apply her own hair products on them and carefully style their hair. What looked like play was already a passion growing.

At the age of 13, she started applying her aunt’s make-up whenever she was going to events, and she would also do her mother’s hair. She became known as a DIY girl, often doing her own hair and leaving people amazed by what she could create.

As she grew older and went to university, that love for beauty followed her. She began styling other students’ hair, sometimes occasionally, sometimes during holidays. Each time, her confidence and skill continued to grow.

In 2025, during her internship, her supervisor, Mr Patrick Moore, believed in her gift and encouraged her to pursue and use what the Living God had placed in her hands. Those words became a turning point. Tshedy took time to reflect, pray, and take her passion seriously.

By the grace of the Living God, in December 2025, she stepped out of her comfort zone and officially began her journey. She hired a station in Maseru town at Olympic Building, Room 4, advertised her business, and God blessed her with clients.

Launching the make-up side of Tshedy’s Beauty Parlour in 2026 had always been a goal, and now that goal is becoming a reality.

Today, Tshedy’s Beauty Parlour stands as a faith-driven beauty brand built on passion, growth, and purpose. Tshedy looks forward to becoming one of the leading make-up artists and hairdressers in Lesotho, while glorifying God and helping every client feel beautiful and confident.

She gives thanks to the Living God for every step of this journey, to her parents for supporting her bold decision, to Mr Patrick Moore for believing in her, and to everyone who continues to support Tshedy’s Beauty Parlour.
