Her braids? Always on point. Never tight, super neat, and beautifully crafted with so much care. You can tell she takes pride in her work. And let’s talk about the vibes; Tshedy is fun, warm, and genuinely engaging. She actually listens, laughs with you, and makes the whole experience enjoyable.

She does my hair with love, patience, and attention to detail, and it shows every time. Hands down, she is one of the best in town!",
